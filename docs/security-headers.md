# Security Headers

This project sets HTTP response headers via the `headers()` function in
`next.config.js`.  The headers are applied to every route.

## Headers in use

| Header | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | See CSP section below | Defence-in-depth against XSS, data injection |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevents clickjacking (legacy; also covered by CSP `frame-ancestors`) |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Stops MIME-type sniffing |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Sends only the origin (not full URL) on cross-origin nav |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` | Isolates the top-level browsing context from cross-origin windows and popups |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` | Stops other origins from embedding or hotlinking app-served resources |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | Enforces HTTPS for 1 year (ignored by browsers on localhost per RFC 6797) |
| `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` | `none` | Blocks Adobe Flash/PDF cross-domain requests (bonus hardening) |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` | Disables sensitive browser features app-wide (bonus hardening) |

## Cross-origin hardening notes

`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` is intentionally retained.
It preserves same-origin analytics/debuggability while reducing cross-origin
URL leakage to the origin only.

`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` narrows the browsing-context group to
same-origin documents. That reduces the cross-origin window surface area and is
safe for the current app because the repo does not show popup-based auth or
cross-origin window messaging requirements.

`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` is the strongest safe default for
this app today. The project serves its own icons, manifest, and social preview
assets from the same origin, and the repo does not indicate any intentional
cross-site embedding or third-party hotlinking requirement.

If the app later adds popup auth, same-site asset sharing, or third-party
embeds, revisit COOP/CORP together rather than weakening only one header.

## About Subresource Integrity

This hardening pass is limited to response headers in `next.config.js`. It does
not add HTML `integrity` attributes or asset-pipeline Subresource Integrity
(SRI) generation for scripts/styles. That would be a separate change with
different build and rendering implications.

## Content-Security-Policy

### Current directives

```
# Development (NODE_ENV=development)
default-src 'self'
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
# Production (NODE_ENV=production)
default-src 'self'
script-src 'self'
style-src 'self'
img-src 'self' data:'
font-src 'self'
connect-src 'self'
frame-src 'self'
object-src 'none'
base-uri 'self'
form-action 'self'
frame-ancestors 'none'
```

| Directive | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default-src` | `'self'` | Baseline — only allow same-origin resources |
| `script-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-eval'` | `'unsafe-eval'` is **only needed in dev** for Next.js Fast Refresh. See below. |
| `style-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` | **Unavoidable** with current Next.js + Tailwind setup. See below. |
| `img-src` | `'self' data:` | Allows inline `data:` URIs (SVGs, etc.) |
| `font-src` | `'self'` | All fonts are self-hosted |
| `connect-src` | `'self'` | API calls only go to the same origin today |
| `frame-src` | `'self'` | No cross-origin iframes |
| `object-src` | `'none'` | Blocks `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>` |
| `base-uri` | `'self'` | Stops `<base>` tag injection |
| `form-action` | `'self'` | Prevents form hijacking to external endpoints |
| `frame-ancestors` | `'none'` | Same protection as `X-Frame-Options: DENY` but CSP-native |

### Unavoidable `'unsafe-inline'` on styles

Next.js injects `<style>` tags at runtime for:

1. **Tailwind CSS** — The JIT compiler emits inline `<style>` blocks during
   development (in production, Tailwind is extracted to static CSS files, but
   Next.js may still inject small inline style blocks for component-level
   styles).
2. **CSS-in-JS / styled-jsx** — If any component uses Next.js's built-in
   styled-jsx, those styles are injected as inline `<style>` tags.
3. **Font optimization** — `next/font` may inject inline critical CSS.

Removing `'unsafe-inline'` from `style-src` will break the dev server
immediately (styles disappear) and may cause subtle breakage in production.

### Path to tighten `style-src`

1. **Short term** — Switch `style-src` to use a **nonce**:
   ```
   style-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'
   ```
   This requires a custom `_document.tsx` that reads a per-request nonce from
   headers and threads it into every `<style>` tag.  Next.js 14 does not yet
   provide a built-in nonce mechanism for all injected styles — you would need
   to maintain a custom `renderToHTML` override or wait for stable nonce
   support in a future Next.js release.

2. **Medium term** — Adopt **strict-dynamic + hashes**:
   ```
   style-src 'self' 'sha256-abc123' 'sha256-def456' 'strict-dynamic'
   ```
   Generate hashes for every inline style block emitted by the production
   build.  This is brittle across builds (hashes change when CSS changes) but
   can be automated in CI with a script that scans the production HTML output
   and updates the CSP header.

3. **Long term** — When the project moves away from Tailwind's runtime
   injection (e.g., to a zero-runtime CSS solution or a fully extracted
   stylesheet), `'unsafe-inline'` can be dropped entirely.

### `'unsafe-eval'` on scripts

Next.js uses `eval()` for **Fast Refresh** in development mode.  This is
**not needed in production** (`next build && next start`).  To tighten:

1. In `next.config.js`, swap the `script-src` line to the production version:
   ```
   "script-src 'self'",
   ```
2. The dev server will break (Fast Refresh stops working), so you may want to
   keep both lines and toggle with an environment variable:
   ```js
   `script-src 'self'${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? " 'unsafe-eval'" : ''}`,
   ```

### Future: wallet integration

The wallet connect flow is currently mocked.  When a real provider (MetaMask,
WalletConnect v2) is integrated, extend the CSP:

```
connect-src 'self' https://*.infura.io wss://*.infura.io wss://relay.walletconnect.com
```

And allow the provider's injected script origin in `script-src` if needed.

## Verifying the headers locally

```bash
# 1. Build the production bundle
npm run build

# 2. Start the production server (defaults to http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# 3. In another terminal, check the headers
curl -I http://localhost:3000 2>&1 | grep -E 'content-security-policy|x-frame|x-content|referrer|strict-transport|permitted-cross|permissions-policy'
```

Or open DevTools → Network tab → click the document request → inspect the
Response Headers section.
